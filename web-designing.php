			<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">Site Architecture And Design</h3>
			<p>Site architecture is the crucial thing in developing a website, for instance before constructing a house we need an engineer to draw the architecture, so also a website needs a designer to develop the architecture which is done at a web designing agency. Website architecture deals with the principles of design and construction and ornamentation of fine websites. Before designing site architecture we need to have a complete research on our Customer, Competitor and Product or Service. Depending upon the research we need to develop content, UI and UX designs for the website. Under UX Design we work on Wireframing, Prototyping, Testing, Development Planning, Execution and Analytics etc. Under UI Design we test Look and Feel, Responsive website, UI Prototyping, Animation, Autofit to all screen sizes and Interactive etc.</p>

			<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">Static & Dynamic Website Design</h3>
			<p>A Static website has stagnant content usually written in HTML code, and every page has to be saved separately on the server. Changes have to be made manually every time, and you need coding knowledge to make any kind of changes. A Dynamic website’s construction is controlled by an application server processed by server-side scripts. Pages of the website are dynamically populated every time and are not coded and saved separately, but the design or template look and feel is saved separately. We at Pracha Technologies, a web designing agency in hyderabad are expertised in creating any sort of complex websites especially ecommerce websites at affordable prices to encourage the startups and mid-level companies .</p>
